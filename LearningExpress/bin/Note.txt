The bin contains executable files which define various ways to start up the Node JS app. 
It is common convention to store executable file in the bin folder.

The www executable file uses the 'app' module of ../'app.js'.

The #! (or the Shebang character) in './bin/www' is used to tell our platform where to find the specific way to interpret our executable file.    [ Syntax :- #!<user folder global to the system>/<global bin in the system>/<enviroment folder> <declaration as node executable file> ].

The start and dev commands of npm have had their paths changed to './bin/www' from 'index.js' because the index.js file has been renamed to app.js and parts of the code (or more specifically app.listen()) have been moved to './bin/www'.
